# Tim-Sort
Tim Sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. It was designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. Invented by Tim Peters in 2002, it is the default sorting algorithm in Python's sort() function and Javaâ€™s Arrays.sort() for non-primitive data types.
